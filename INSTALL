To build, make any necessary modifications to the Makefiles in the main
directory, common, doc, zgoubi, zpop, zpop/liblns, and zpop/liblns/doc, and
type "make -f 'myMakefile'' (to build the programs) or "make docs" (to build the documentation). 
(with 'myMakefile'' one of Makefile_zgoubi_gfortran, Makefile_zgoubi_ifort, Makefile_zpop, ...)
This should build zgoubi and/or zpop, and/or the documentation.

The makefiles should work on a system with gfrotran, or ifort.

We will come up with a better system at some point.
