To build, make any necessary modifications to the Makefiles in the main
directory, common, doc, zgoubi, zpop, zpop/liblns, and zpop/liblns/doc, and
type "make" (to build the programs) or "make doc" (to build the documentation.
This should build zgoubi, zpop, and the documentation.

The makefiles should work on a system with g77.

We will come up with a better system at some point.
