1/ First, gunzip warmSnake.map

2/ rzg -in centeredHelix_FIT&save[&nofinal].res 

This will produce zgoubi.res, which can be compared - and should be identical - to centeredHelix_FIT&save[&nofinal].res.

This will also produce zgoubi.plt (since IL=20 in 'TOSCA'), whose content can be plotted (using zpop, or gnuplot). A figure identical to centeredHelix.eps is obtained if a final run is allowed after FIT (case of file centeredHelix_FIT&save.res). 

3/ What centeredHelix does : 

- At start, Zgoubi execution pointer points sequentially from OBJET down to FIT, tracking one particle with initial coordinate Y=-2.2cm.

- Meeting FIT causes the pointer to be sent back to OBJET for fitting purposes, until the requested penalty=1e-2 is fulfilled.

- Then, the execution pointer carries on beyond FIT and so will meet REBELOTE, which causes the following : 
  (i) parameter 35 in OBJET (i.e., the relative rigidity of the particle, D, initially 1.) is changed to the next value, 1.3872739973
  (ii) the execution pointer is sent back to OBJET and a new FIT process starts
  (iii) and so on until the number of 'rebelotes' has reached 5, as requested in REBELOTE, so completing a total of 5 FITs, each one with a different value of D.



NOTE - Some more infos, about what FIT does : 

It requests the helical particle motion in the snake field map (keyword #6 in the data list) to be centered (constraint type 7.3) on the field map axis, together with equal initial and final coordiantes at snake's ends, Y=Y_0 and T=T_0 (constraints type 3.1). The variables are the initial horizontal position, Y, and angle, T, of the particle in OBJET. 

The figure centeredHelix.eps shows the 5 pairs of helices, one is before the FIT, non-centerd, and one centered as follows from the FIT procedure. This figure takes its data from zgoubi.plt, which is filled thanks to the option IL=2[0[00[...]]] under 'TOSCA'.
