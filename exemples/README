 
These examples are maintained. Efforts are made to ensure that they are run-able with the latest version of zgoubi executable on the author's "trunk" branch. In particular some are part of the tools/compare procdure which tests their repeatability.


The example sub-folders found in exemple have the similar following content : 

- one or more zgoubi input data files for a given example (a file with suffix ".dat"), and the corresponding result files (*.res suffix), and sometimes in addition *.eps plot files or other forms of computation outputs, 

- or just one or more result files (suffix ".res")

Zgoubi needs a zgoubi.dat as input file. That zgoubi.dat is obtained by copy-pasting 'thisExampleDataFile.dat' or 'thisExampleDataFile.res' file in that folder, to zgoubi.dat. (that works with a .res file since the first part of a '.res' zgoubi result file is a copy of the zgoubi.dat file that it stems from).  
Note that Zgoubi, instead, also accepts the command 'zgoubi -inFile thisExampleDataFile.dat/.res. 

Some of these examples are discussed in Part C of the users' guide. 


The folder exemples/tools is dedicated to the following : 

- running 'compare' will run some of the examples, and compare their outcomes (logged in compare.out) with reference ones logged in compare.out_reference. 
Absence of (major) differences between compare.out_reference and compare.out is a sign of a good installation of zgoubi.
