These examples are maintained. Efforts are made to ensure that they are run-able with the latest version of zgoubi executable on the author's "trunk" branch. In particular some are part of the tools/compare procdure which tests their repeatability.

The various folders contain 

- one or more zgoubi input data files for a given example (a file with suffix ".dat"), and the corresponding result files (*.res suffix), and sometimes in addition *.eps plot files or other forms of computation outputs, 

- or just one or more result files (suffix ".res")

Zgoubi needs a zgoubi.dat as input file. It is obtained by copy-pasting a *.dat or a *.res file to zgoubi.dat. (that works with a .res file since the first part of a zgoubi result file is a copy of the zgoubi.dat file that it stems from).  

Some of these examples are discussed in Part C of the users' guide. 

Some of these examples have been subject to publication. In that case a 'doc' folder provides the publication(s) of concern, 
for deeper insight.
