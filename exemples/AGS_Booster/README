TWISS performs 3 passes through the lattice sequence so to get chromaticities
It also gets the periodic optical functions, which it finally transports along the sequence, and stores in zgoubi.TWISS.out.

OPTICS.dat transports the initial optical functions, as stated in OBJET/KOBK=5.01, along the lattice.
Since the initial optical functions happen to be the periodic ones in this example, optical functions as 
transported by OPTICS will be the same as by TWISS, above. 
The PRINT option in 'OPTICS' allows saving the optical functions in zgoubi.OPTICS.out.
