Files setup by Yann Dutheil, BNL, 02/26/15 : 

A realitic AGS lattice in polarized proton configuration at ~20GeV.
 
The lattice includes the 3D Opera maps of the two helical dipole snakes (TOSCA keywords). Including, in the cold snake case, 
an adjustable linear combination of its, independent, solenoidal and helix components.  

In this example Zgoubi computes the periodic functions along the AGS, they are stored in zgoubi.TWISS.out, formatted in 
a similar way to equivalent MADX type of twiss output file.

A couple of tricks : 

'OPTIONS'   with argument  "WRITE OFF/ON" 
is used here so to inhibit zgoubi outputs to zgoubi.res between  "'MARKER'   #Start" and "  'MARKER'   #End" keywords. 
This saves a lot of CPU time. 

'SCALING' 
reads the scaling of a series of optical elements from the "powerSupplies.in" file. This further allows full acceleration
cycle from 2.51 to 25.38 GeV (injection energy into RHIC) if desired, by introducing the 'CAVITE' keyword.
