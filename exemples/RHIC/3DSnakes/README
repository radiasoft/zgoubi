1/
'rzg -fileIn snake1Segment.inc'  and  'rzg -fileIn snake1Segment.inc'  will zero 
the snake induced orbit orbit  at G.gamma=45.5. 

They use the FIT procedure and dedicated 'snaKH' and 'snaKV' kickers. 

2/
'rzg -fileIn TWISS.dat' will execute zgoubi's TWISS procedure, producing Twiss functions 
and a MADX like output, zgoubi.TWISS.out

TWISS.dat accounts for 1/ as it 'INCLUDEs' snake1Segment.inc,  -fileIn snake1Segment.inc

Content of zgoubi.TWISS.out can be plotted using ~/zgoubi-code/toolbox/gnuplotFiles/gnuplot_TWISS/gnuplot_TWISS.cmd

3/ 
orbit.dat stores (in b_zgoubi.fai) the orbit at all 'QUAD'

4/ 
A note in passing : 

Comparison of TWISS computation results at the end of 

TWISS.res 
and 
TWISS_snakesOFF.res

show that tunes change from 

                    NU_Y =  0.68194815         NU_Z =  0.73614615    
to
                    NU_Y =  0.68499553         NU_Z =  0.67299602    

So, this simulation corroboates the known observation that snakes induce Delta_Qy ~ +0.05. 

It also says that they change chromas by ~1.9 unit, from 2 to ~3.9.
