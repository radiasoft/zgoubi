Generate a field map using keyword OPTIONS/CONSTY ON.  Use it for 50-particle tracking or 50-orbit MATRIX computation. 

How this works : 

1/ 'rzg -in consty_impdev_IX-567.IR-61.IZ-5.res' will generate zgoubi.res and zgoubi.impdev.out (thelatter, as a consequence of
IL=7 under 'FFAG' keyword)

2/ compile impdev2FieldMap.f and run impdev2FieldMap. This will read from zgoubi.impdev.out, reorganize field and corrdintaes 
data it founds therein, and restitute that under the form of a field map (impdev2FieldMap.out) that 'TOSCA' keyword 
will be able to use. 

3/ 'rzg -in fieldMap_50traj_IX-567_dR2cm_dZ1cm.res' and 'rzg -in fieldMap_MATRIX_IX-567_dR2cm_dZ1cm.res' provide two 
examples that use that field map. 
The first one tracks 50 particles with initial coordinates taken on closed orbits at various momenta. 
The second one computes the matrices at these 50 different momenta.
