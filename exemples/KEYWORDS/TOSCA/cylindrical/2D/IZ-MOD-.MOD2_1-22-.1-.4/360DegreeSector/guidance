1/ TOSCA keyword is popular to handle field maps. Notations below are those found in ZUG, keyword 'TOSCA'.
See "The various IZ, MOD and MOD2 possibilities, when using TOSCA", ZUG, p.~291: IZ=1, MOD=22, MOD2=1

TOSCA is expecting to first find a few line header (arbitrary comments). Then follows the field map, 
namely, NX*NY lines giving :

Y Z X BY BZ BX         Angle X varies first, from a1 to a2 such that a2-a1=total angle, 
                       then Y, from R_min to R_max. Z is zero always
                       Assuming  a dipole magnet with mid-plane symmetry, BX=BY=0 always.

Units are arbitrary as the second lines of data under TOSCA allows setting units. Should eventually be kG (B), rad (X), cm (Y).

NX is the number of angular steps, from entrance boundary to exit boundary of the map, such that AT = (NX-1)*dA, with AT
the total angular extent of the map (60 degrees here) and dA the angle increment of the mesh.

NY is the number of steps in radius, from boundary at R_min to boundary at R_max of the map, such that the radial 
extent is (NY-1)*dR, with dR the radius increment of the mesh.

It is advised to take dA such that RM*dA~few mm, to start with.


Two possible ways to generate that field map are as follows: 

(i) Write an appropriate piece of code which will do it

(ii) From an existing Zgoubi model based for instance on DIPOLE or CYCLOTRON, use CONSTY keyword. 


2/ Note the possibility of field map supreimposition with 22.2 (22.1 instead with single map) :
