Subfolders "6GeV" ... "18GeV" : 

Particle bunches are launched with all 3 emittances zero, for several damping times.

This tracking yields both horizontal and longitudinal equilibrium emittances. 

Matching with damping law (actually growth) yields horizontal and longitudinal damping times.


------

Subfolder "coupled" : 

A skew quadrupole has been introduced at the start of the structure (this is the essential difference with 
the previous cases). 

The skew field is 3000 kG, integrated field BL=0.003T.m, strength 0.003m^-1. 

The coupling thus amounts to ey/ex~0.58.
