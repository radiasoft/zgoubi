* Initial input file is copide from /home/meot/zgoubi/struct/saturne/grorud/grorud_2006.dat

* Game here is to resume tracking after stop at turn number 1000

* zgoubi.fai save is at start of turn, thus rays are saved w/ coordiantes at start of turn 1000
It is next copied to turn1000.fai for read by grorud_resume.dat.

* turn1000.fai is read using OBJET/kobj=3 (*NOT* 3.N, N.ne.0)

* CAVITE/opt=2 is used to accelerate.  It is equipped for recovering (A couple of tests on kobj=3)
(using different CAVITE option is possible, but cosmetics for handling kobj3 recovery must be added, in cavite.f).

* In grorud_resume.dat I had to change    3 0. 0. 0. to    3 0. 0. -0.1963495506854311, otherwise it yields wrong arc length and wrong deviation:
                Arc length    =   2.484246E+02 cm
                Deviation    =   2.252182E+01 deg.,    3.930798E-01 rad
     KPOS =  3 :  automatic positioning of element, 
        XCE, YCE, ALE =   0.000000000       0.000000000     -0.1965399193     cm/cm/rad
instead of (grorud_2006.dat):
                Arc length    =   2.481838E+02 cm
                Deviation    =   2.250000E+01 deg.,    3.926991E-01 rad
     KPOS =  3 :  automatic positioning of element, 
        XCE, YCE, ALE =   0.000000000       0.000000000     -0.1963495507     cm/cm/rad

This is because the A73, when actualized by chxc (jeust after 1st pass by bendi)
does not take the expected value -0.1963495506854311. 
I do not have to do that in grorud.dat, only in grorud_resume.dat.
Pourtant, scaler computes, correctly, same scal at turn 1000 in grorud_2006, and at turn 1 in groryd_resume:
  scaler         1000   5.0186700000000002        9.5702950229936690E-004   1.0000000000000000        5.0234730152523053     
  scaler            1   5.0186700000000002        9.5702950200000003E-004   1.0000000000000000        5.0234730152508025     
so, scal ends up the same in bendi, and dev should not be changed... I can't figue...

Anyway, with "3 0. 0. ale=-dev/2" it works...

* spinMotion.eps shows great overlapping of spin over turns 1-2000 from grorud_resume (over the 1000-3000 region in the graph), on top of grorud_2600's 1-3000 tracking.
