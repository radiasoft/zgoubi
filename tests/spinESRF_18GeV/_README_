This test, spinESRF_18GeV, was derived from earlier simulations of the
ESRF, a 6 GeV light source in Grenoble, France. Here we run at 18 GeV
so as to yield a much shorter damping time for this test. We track just
ten electrons around the 0.8km ring. Synchrotron radiation is ON (though
only in dipole fields), and spin tracking is ON. The 6D motion of the
electrons converges, on average, to the equilibrium emittance of this
ring (zero vertically). The transverse damping time is about 50 turns.
(See the turn-*.eps files for some context.)
