%% IMPORTANT COPYRIGHT NOTICE: 
%% 
%% You are NOT ALLOWED to distribute this file alone. 
%% 
%% You are allowed to distribute this file under the condition that it 
%% is distributed together with all the files listed in manifest.txt. 
%% 
%% If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain! 
%% 
%% 
%% Permission is granted to copy this file to another file with a 
%% clearly different name and to customize the declarations in that 
%% copy to serve the needs of your installation, provided that you 
%% comply with the conditions in the file legal.txt.

%% However, NO PERMISSION is granted to generate or to distribute a 
%% modified version of this file under its original name. 
%% 
%% You are NOT ALLOWED to change this file. 
%% 
%% 
%% MODIFICATION ADVICE: 
%% 
%% If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of 
%% the source file(s) from which it was produced. Use a different 
%% name for your copy(ies) and modify the copy(ies); this will ensure 
%% that your modifications do not get overwritten when you install a 
%% new release of the standard system. You should also ensure that 
%% your modified source file does not generate any modified file with 
%% the same name as a standard file. 
%% 
%% You can then easily distribute your modifications by distributing 
%% the modified and renamed copy of the source file, taking care to 
%% observe the conditions in legal.txt; this will ensure that other 
%% users can safely use your modifications. 
%% 
%% You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to 
%% control the generation of files from your source file; this file 
%% should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not 
%% those in the standard .ins files. 
%% 
%% The names of the source files used are shown above.
