CODE DEVELOPMENTS

---
There are still several common files between zgoubi and zpop.  Unfortunately
they are sufficiently different that one cannot use the one routine in both
programs.  In addition, there is an inconsistency in zpop in the layout of the
common block CDF (RFFAG uses the layout found in zgoubi).  I think we should
try to make all of the common files (particularly the r* files) consistent.

---
Determine if the current FFLAGS are necessary, and make changes to the code so that they are not.

---
Fix the warnings, in particular the one about tempnam.

---
Install periodic dispersion when coupled, in matrix and twiss. 


---
Install call tunesc in ff

---
Have same manipulation of labels at the top of zgoubi.f by OPTICS, FAISTORE, SPNSTORE, PICKUPS

---
In lipsFromFai :
- in the case that dispersion is removed :  some NOELs found in zgoubi.fai are not present in zgoubi.OPTICS.out. In 
that case what is provided following reading from the latter is D=0 and D'=0. This can be fixed by removing from 
the computation any NOEL in zgoubi.fai which wouild not have its match in  zgoubi.OPTICS.out.

DEBUGGING, ZGOUBI 


* 1/

1-B/
If I compil using : 
FC=gfortran
FFLAGS= -Wall -pedantic

then FIT stops, like that : 
                    FIT  variables  in  good  order,  FIT  will proceed. 
                    Final FIT status will be saved in zgoubi.FITVALS.out                                                              
 Error  open  file warmSnake.map                                                                   
 Leaving...    Occured in element # 6
End of job !

whereas, using 
FFLAGS=-O4 -Wall -fno-automatic -pedantic
then it does work, and without optimiwer : 
FFLAGS= -Wall -fno-automatic -pedantic
works too.

1-D/
On the other hand, 
REBELOTE alone dose work, see for instance ~/zgoubi/struct/bnl/rhic/topicsWithHaixin/n0-TiltAtPolarmtr_150209/test

May be need some save in zgoubi_main ?


* 2/ 
FIT[2] pose probleme p.ex. avec thomas et hrs-desir, had to had "write(89,*)..." to solve it temporarily. Look up 'REWIND(89) in sources.


* 3/
../AGS/matrix/  yields "Maximum # steps allowed =       100000 .  At element number           89" on my laptop. It works if 0.960563380282 is shortened to 0.960563380 or less, or if 'WRITE OFF' is changed to 'WRITE ON'.
