There are still several common files between zgoubi and zpop.  Unfortunately
they are sufficiently different that one cannot use the one routine in both
programs.  In addition, there is an inconsistency in zpop in the layout of the
common block CDF (RFFAG uses the layout found in zgoubi).  I think we should
try to make all of the common files (particularly the r* files) consistent.
Here is the list of the remaining routines which should be checked (some of
which are not really common routines):

block.f
debstr.f
finstr.f
flush2.f
header.f
idluni.f
lpsfit.f
okkt.f
prdata.f
raiman.f
rautor.f
rbend.f
rbinar.f
rcarte.f
rcavit.f
rcible.f
rcoils.f
rcolli.f
rcsr.f
rdips.f
rebmul.f
rel2tu.f
relcmi.f
relcyl.f
relmir.f
rffags.f
rfit.f
rfitgt.f
rgasca.f
rhelix.f
rmcdes.f
rmcobj.f
rmulti.f
rnorma.f
robjet.f
robjta.f
rqsod.f
rsepar.f
rsimb.f
rsolen.f
rspn.f
rsrlos.f
rtrans.f
rundul.f
runipo.f
rwienf.f
sref.f

Make the documentation consistent with the code.

Determine if the current FFLAGS are necessary, and make changes to the code
so that they are not.

Fix the warnings, in particular the one about tempnam.

--------------------
Install periodic dispersion when coupled, in matrix and twiss. 

Install call tunesc in ff, twiss

Actualize 'publications'. For the moment only copy-pasted main zgoubi (and only zgoubi) stuff found in :
