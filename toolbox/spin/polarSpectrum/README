Created for eRHIC e-storage ring. 

What it does : 

- compute average p and p^2 over a few damping times traking, from what it deduces p_av and sig_p
- stores the last read values of spin components

That allows ploting spin components vs p_av and sig_p vs p_av.


It was observed that over 1 a.gamma unit, sig_p/p_ref~1e-3.
