One can run geneMap on stand alone :  that generates a field map and the 
corresponding  zgoubi.dat.
Prior to running geneMap, (i) compile : "f77 -o geneMap geneMap.f", 
(ii) make sure geneMap.data contains the desired data values. 

One can choose to execute ./scanKXi.  That will run scanKxi thus generating 
a series of field maps (by iterated calls geneMap) and related closed 
orbit / stability limits searches
