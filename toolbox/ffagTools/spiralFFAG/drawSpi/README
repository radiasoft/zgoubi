-----------------

scanKXi realises MAD8 execution including a double loop on xi and on K. 
Given that MAD8 only acepts 1 do loop at a time the loop on xi is internal to the MAD file, whereas 
the loop on K is obtained thanks to an external fortran call in a do loop. 

executing scanKXi requires lattice.cmd that loops on xi, and scanKXi.data that tells 
the K interval for loop wrt. K. 

To run scanKXi : just "scanKXi", this is an alias of 
/home/fmeot/mad/structure/ffag/tools/scanKXi/scanKXi,  defined in .Login_mad


In principle the local directory needs to contain lattice.cmd, scanKXi.data, lattice.data and only that. 

The scanKXi alias will create eps outputs, log.tex and log.ps files, scanKXi.res, and drawSpi.res.
