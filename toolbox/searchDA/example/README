* searchDA can be used for synchrotrons, FFAGs, cyclotrons, in the same way for all, described below. 

* The executable is "searchDA". It has to be run in the folder where both searchDA.in and zgoubi_searchDA-In.dat 
  stand, see below.

* Lattice of concern in this example is EMMA type of doublet. It has the merit of yielding a 
  fast example (just a couple of quads to be tracked in).

* What searchDA does : 

searchDA will look for the DA, in (x,y) space (the (Y,Z) space in Zgoubi notations) at one or more 
momenta,  as specified by the user in the input file "zgoubi_searchDA-In.dat" see below.
It does that in the following way : 
  - 1/ look for the maximum stable x, xM
  - 2/ look for the maximum stable x, xm
  - 3/ look for the maximum stable y at various x values in the [xm,xM] interval.
To achieve that, searchDA essentially runs zgoubi executable (by "system calls"), a repeated number of times, 
after shaping zgoubi.dat in an appropriate way. 


* Using searchDA : 
 
A/ searchDA requires two input files : 

	 1/ "searchDA.in", which tells DA search conditions - see therein
	 2/ a zgoubi input data file named "zgoubi_searchDA-In.dat". 

B/ as to zgoubi_searchDA-In.dat : 

   1/ Make sure that zgoubi_searchDA-In.dat does run (copy it to zgoubi.dat and run zgoubi, to check that)
   2/ zgoubi_searchDA-In.dat must have an 'OBJET' of type 2.  Number of particles is arbitrary.  
      Each particle in this type-2 object has a particular momentum. searchDA will look for the DA for each momentum 
      that appears there.  

C/ run searchDA in the presence of its two input data files.  While executing, searchDA writes its outputs into 
   searchDA.out, which can be examined (e.g., using emacs) simultaneously. 

D/ results in  searchDA.out are organized in such a way to allow direct plot  using gnuplot. 
   "gnuplot <./gnuplot_DA.cmd", in the present package, does that. It reads from searchDA.out and produces 
    gnuplot_DAs.eps. 
    gnuplot_DA.cmd may need some adjustment depending on the number of momenta or other user's needs.
