searchCO.f looks for closed orbits. 

All it requires is an input data file, zgoubi_searchCO-In.dat, which contains the periodic structure. 

The OBJET/[KOBJ=2] in zgoubi_searchCO-In.dat contains initial coordinates with diverse momenta. 

searchCO will look for the closed orbit for all these momenta. Results will be saved in zgoubi_searchCO-Out.dat.

Other files are produced for further use, once the orbits have been found, as zgoubi_searchCO-Out_MATRIX.dat for MATRIX computation, etc. searchCO also produces a .pdf report of the actions undertaken and results obtained, saved in Log_CO folder. 

An input data file to searchCO is also created if it does not exist, with default arguments that can next be changed if desired. 

An example can be run in the "exemple" folder (just go there, and execute ../searchCO).
