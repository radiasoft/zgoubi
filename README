This is ZGOUBI, a program for computing the trajectories of charged particles.

The directory layout is as follows:

common   : Fortran files common to zgoubi and zpop
doc      : Zgoubi users' guide, Zgoubi.pdf
exemples : Examples of zgoubi input/ouptu files
include  : Include files common to zgoubi and zpop
toolbox  : A library of small programs that perform elementary data treatment functions (find orbit, betatron functions, DA, etc.)
zgoubi   : The zgoubi program itself
zpop     : A program for plotting/analyzing zgoubi results

In this folder, "make" will create zgoubi executable and zpop executable, in that order. 

Note that "make" may require ifort, or gfortran, or else. Comment/un-comment the FC variable and its attributes, 
as needed, in Makefile_zgoubi.

Problem ? in that case : fmeot@bnl.gov, jsberg@bnl.gov
