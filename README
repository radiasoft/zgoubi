This is ZGOUBI, a program for computing the trajectories of charged particles.

The directory layout is as follows:

common   : Fortran files common to zgoubi and zpop
coupling : Fortran files part of zgoubi, dedicated to coupled optics computation from transport matrix (Edwards-Teng method) 
guide    : Zgoubi users' guide, Zgoubi.pdf
exemples : Examples of zgoubi input/ouput files
include  : Include files common to zgoubi and zpop
modules  : The field map array HC may be huge (this is determined in PARIZ.H), thus it is subjected to dynamic allocation memory
toolbox  : A library of small programs that perform elementary data treatment functions (find orbit, betatron functions, DA, etc.).
           Includes translators, e.g., from MAD[8,X] to Zgoubi
zgoubi   : The zgoubi program itself
zpop     : A program for plotting/analyzing zgoubi results

In this folder, "make" (or "make -f Makefile_zgoubi_gfortran", or "make -f Makefile_zgoubi_ifort") will create zgoubi executable. 
"make -f Makefile_zpop" or "make -f Makefile_zpop_gfortran" will create zpop executable.

Note that "make" may require ifort, or gfortran, or else. Comment/un-comment the FC variable and its attributes, 
as needed, in these various Makefiles.
