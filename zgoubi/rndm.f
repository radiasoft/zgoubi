      FUNCTION RNDM()
C-- For ifort compiler. Comment otherwise
CCCCCCCCCCCC        use ifport
C While not required, the recommend usage of the Intel Fortran portability 
C library functions is to access these either by inserting a USE IFPORT in 
C the calling program, or by including iflport.f90 from the INCLUDE directory 
C of your compiler distribution as part of your program. 
C Use *without* the USE IFPORT (or iflport.f90) in conjunction with high-level 
C optimizations may cause programs to suffer a run-time segmentation fault 
C associated with calling the portability function. This is not a compiler defect.
