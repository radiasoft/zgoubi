The basic theory of the helical wiggler will be reviewed, and the computer lab work will be aimed at reproducing, from ray-tracing, its essential outcomes.

This will include~: 

- magnetic field in the HW

- orbits

- angular distribution of SR

- SR spectral brightness

- Comparison with SR from bending magnet and planar wiggler
