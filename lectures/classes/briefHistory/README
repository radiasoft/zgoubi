Plan of these introductory courses :

the 1h40 will be shared, half-half, between



\begin{itemize}
\item[] a brief history of partical accelerators

That will allow us to point to the particular types of accelerators that we will study during this semester.

It will allow to

\begin{itemize}
\item[] place and introduce them, more or less chronologically, in their historical context
\item[] discuss the interconnections between their mutual developments
\item[] stress the important developments today in the field
\item[] point out their role in  many fields  of fundamental research and applications
\end{itemize}
\item[] an introduction to ray-tracing, particle tracking, and other beam optics, centered on the 
paramount method of concern~: computer methods and computer simulations. 
\end{itemize}

The latter will constitute the bulk of these courses~: 

- computer laboratory work, during which we will learn about these machines, working principles, properties, 
and about the beam they provide, from zero-mass to heaviest particle beams,

- a bot of homework in preparation of the course to come.

~

In paralle, we will organize a computer code project~:

- CEBAF is a 12 GeV RLA,

- we will transform it into a 8~GeV ERL~!

We will perform beam physics related code development and computer simulations, 
regarding for instance time-of-flight spectrometry aspects of the
installation and its operation, CSR, mutliple-pass BBU, synchrotron radiation, etc.
