This computer lab session deals with the isochronous cyclotron.

The basic theory of the isochronous cyclotron will be reviewed, and the computer lab work will be aimed at reproducing, from ray-tracing, its essential outcomes.

This will include~: 

- magnetic field in the IC

- orbits

- momentum range and isochronism

- betatron wave numbers

- isochronous acceleration and longitudinal motion

- large amplitude motion and dynamical acceptance

- resonance crossing, tune diagram and beam footprint~: momentum and amplitude detuning
