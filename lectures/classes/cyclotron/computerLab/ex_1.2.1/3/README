rzg -in cyclo_DIPOLE.dat 

cyclo_DIPOLE.dat tracks particles in a 6-sector ring. 

coordinates stored in zgoubi.fai can be plotted using zpop

IL=1 will store coordinates across sector(s) in zgoubi.plt. zpop can be used to plot.

Problem here : part #2 (that with T.n.e0) in dipole 5, at the last step, the last position is beyond 
the edge of the field region, thus the flying grid starddles the edge.
Thus derivatives are non zero as field on the grid nodes has some values 0.
That jeopardizes the field and motion.
