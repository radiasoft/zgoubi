k is set to -0.3, so to preserve 0.2 to 5 MeV stable range. Apart from this consideration, -0.3 is arbitrary

1/ look for orbit at 200keV - it has changed, due to k

rzg -in cyclo_classical_km0.3_200keVOrbit.dat

Notes :
- I used zpop to get central coordinates of ellipse. It is possible to use PICKUPS instead, and avoid plotting.
- It is possible to use searchCOs_From1Traj instead, or write a search of c.o. in python


2/ Scan mom for orbits :
