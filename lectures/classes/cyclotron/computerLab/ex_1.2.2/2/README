k is set to -0.3, this preserve 0.2 to 5 MeV stable range, and only changes a little 
orbit radii compared to k=0. Apart from these two considerations, -0.3 is arbitrary

1/ look for orbits at 200keV and other 3 momenta

Notes :
- I use zpop to get central coordinates of ellipse. It is possible to use PICKUPS instead, and avoid plotting.
- It is possible to use searchCOs_From1Traj instead, or write a search of c.o. in python


2/ Get MATRIX

rzg -in cyclo_classical_km0.3_4mom_MATRIX.dat

3/ MATRIX yields periodic functions at 5 MeV. These are used to set up a 1mu_m invariant particle.
Then run track it

rzg -in cyclo_classical_km0.3_4mom_5MeVInvariant.dat

I use tunesFromFai to get the tunes - make sure tunesFromFai.In says 'zgoubi.fai'. zpop can be used too. 

4/ Envelopes : 

rzg -in cyclo_classical_km0.3_4mom_Envelopes.dat 

and plot, using zpop for instance. Y and Z envelopes appears to be ~constant. Why ? Check maths.
