Using OBJET[KOBJ=5], trajectories #2 and 3 are at an angle wrt traj. #1 which is taken as the reference.
They can be plotted to check the property. 

Limited of accuracy on matrix computation (by parameterization) has the fortunate of allowing checking that 
NU_Y~1 (it is in theory exactly 1).
The vertical transport matrix shos that the vertical motion is a drift (of length s/cos(P)), so, no periodic stability.
