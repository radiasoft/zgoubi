Hi Francois,

The stable energies for this machine lie in the range 118 MeV to 612 MeV.

The reason for this is that the coefficients of the field expansion were obtained from fitting of the measured field of the PSI machine. Given that the flutter changes a lot at injection these coefficients have to be re-calculated for the injection region and then they will become dependent on the radius which is avoided here for simplicity.

Also, the radial field law is a polynomial fit with the coefficients specified in the input file. The polynomial fit only works for the main part 120 MeV to 600 MeV and fails at the bondaries.

HI Francois,

I'm looking at it now. I think I know the problem ..

Malek,

Je suis en train de bosser sur 'cyclotron.res' (attached) - je prepare un exercise de computer Lab

aurais-tu une version de cet engin qui fonctionne de 72 a 560 MeV ?  Peut-etre cela necessite-t-il une version recente de cyclotron ?  (j'ai l'impression que c'est la recherche numerique du zero - FUNCT? - qui se scotche a partir, ou en dessous, d'une certaine energie)
