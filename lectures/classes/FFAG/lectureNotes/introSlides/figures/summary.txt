 Fixed Field Altlernating Gradient acceleration methods. A review, present projects. 

Fixed Field Alternating Gradient acceleration methods were initiated in the early 50's. They have 
regained interest in the recent years in the context of increasing demand for high intensity and 
fast acceleration. A review of the technique and projects will be performed, including possible 
applications that span a large spectrum of machines from proton drivers to the acceleration of 
muons for the neutrino factory.
