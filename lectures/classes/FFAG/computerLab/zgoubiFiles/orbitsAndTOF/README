An FFAG fixed-field ring is considered in this exercise. It is a model of the Kyushu and 
KURRI 150 MeV proton, radial sector, FFAGs. 

Zgoubi data file contains a single periodic-cell of the otherwise 12-cell ring. We will play with that cell : 
       - compute closed orbits from injection energy (12 MeV) to extraction energy (150 MeV)
       - compute transport matrices (also called '1 turn map') for each of these orbits
       - compute tunes, chromaticites (~zero !) as a function of energy
       - push some particles to very large excursion to observe non-lnear motion
       - compute amplitudee-dependence of H and V betatron frequencies (tunes)
       - and more...

In this folder we find 2 different ways to find closed orbits over the energy span of the FFAG ring:

(i) either using the FIT and REBELOTE keywords, the command is :
   rzg -in running findOrbits_uFIT_REBELOTE_nofinal.res_svn703_ifort.
This zgoubi run will produce zgoubi.fai which stores the closed orbits as found, zgoubi.fai 
is further saved in closedOrbits.fai by the 'SYSTEM' command.

(ii) or using  'searchCOs_From1Traj' from the toolbox, the command is : 
   ./searchCOs_From1Traj,   
   and requires,  
       - zgoubi input file 'searchCO_from1Traj-In.dat' and 
       - searchCOs_From1Traj input file 'searchCO.data'. 
   This is an algothym in fortran. A similar tool can be found in pyZgoubi.
This searchCOs_From1Traj tool will produce searchCOs.out which stores the closed orbits as found.

Time-of-flight on these orbits (i.e., the revolution time T_rev) allows defining the accelerating 
cavity frequency law f_RF = h / T_rev, used for pulsed acceleration (the cavity voltage is pulsed, with 
a frequency swing).
